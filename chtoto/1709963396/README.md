# Down For Me

Allow your pawn to pretend to be downed.

No more wounded pawn crawling back to nearest medical unit.

Now you can set them down and take care of them, without having to punch them until they are knocked out ;)

Thanks to @5katz for the suggestion.

## FAQ

***Do enemies stop attacking "fake downed" pawn ?***

*Yes you can assimilate the "Fake down" by "Play the dead" in this kind of situation but be careful they can sometimes kidnap your "fake downed" colonists even if they are not wounded, so if you use it to avoid raids it can be dangerous*

***I cannot force down one colonist/animal***

*Only not mentally broken colonists and tamed animals with obedience can be forced to be down !*

***Is this savegame compatible?***

*Yes*
